title: 서브그래프 생성하기
---

Graph CLI를 사용하기 전에, 여러분은 [Subgraph Studio](https://thegraph.com/studio)에서 서브그래프를 생성해야 합니다. 그런 다음 여러분들은 여러분의 서브그래프 프로젝트를 설정하고 선택한 플랫폼에 배포할 수 있게 될 것입니다. **Ethereum 메인넷을 인덱싱하지 않는 서브그래프는 The Graph Network에 게시되지 않는다**는 것을 참고하시기 바랍니다.

`graph init` 명령은 퍼블릭 이더리움 네트워크의 기존 컨트랙트나 예제 서브그래프에서 새 서브그래프 프로젝트를 설정하는 데 사용할 수 있습니다. 이 명령은 `graph init --product subgraph-studio`에 전달되어 Subgraph Studio에서 서브그래프를 생성하는 데 사용될 수 있습니다. 이더리움 메인넷이나 테스트넷 중 하나에 이미 스마트 컨트랙트를 배포한 경우 해당 컨트랙트에서 새 서브그래프를 부트스트랩하는 것이 시작하기에 좋은 방법일 수 있습니다. 그러나 먼저 The Graph가 지원하는 네트워크에 대해 조금 알아보도록 하겠습니다.

## 지원 네트워크

그래프 네트워크는 메인넷 이더리움을 인덱싱하는 서브그래프들을 지원합니다:

- `mainnet`

**호스티드 서비스 상에서 베타 형태로 지원되는 추가 네트워크들**:

- `mainnet`
- `kovan`
- `rinkeby`
- `ropsten`
- `goerli`
- `poa-core`
- `poa-sokol`
- `xdai`
- `near-mainnet`
- `near-mainnet`
- `matic`
- `mumbai`
- `fantom`
- `bsc`
- `chapel`
- `clover`
- `avalanche`
- `fuji`
- `celo`
- `celo-alfajores`
- `fuse`
- `moonriver`
- `mbase`
- `arbitrum-one`
- `arbitrum-rinkeby`
- `optimism`
- `optimism-kovan`
- `aurora`
- `aurora-testnet`

The Graph의 호스팅 서비스는 기본 기술, 즉 제공된 JSON RPC 엔드포인트의 안정성과 신뢰성에 의존합니다. 새로운 네트워크는 네트워크가 안정성, 신뢰성 및 확장성 측면에서 자체적으로 입증될 때까지 베타 버전으로 표시됩니다. 이 베타 기간 동안 가동 중지 및 예기치 않은 동작이 발생할 위험이 존재합니다.

비 메인넷 네트워크를 인덱싱하는 서브그래프를 [Subgraph Studio](/studio/subgraph-studio)의 탈중앙화 그래프 네트워크에 게시**할 수 없음** 을 기억하십시오.

## 기존 컨트렉트로부터

다음 명령은 기존 컨트렉트의 모든 이벤트를 인덱싱하는 서브그래프를 생성합니다. 이는 Etherscan에서 컨트렉트 ABI를 가져오려고 시도하고 로컬 파일 경로를 다시 요청합니다. 만약 어떤 선택적 인수라도 누락된 경우, 이는 대화형 양식을 통해 여러분을 안내합니다.

```sh
graph init \
  --product subgraph-studio
  --from-contract <CONTRACT_ADDRESS> \
  [--network <ETHEREUM_NETWORK>] \
  [--abi <FILE>] \
  <SUBGRAPH_SLUG> [<DIRECTORY>]
```

`<SUBGRAPH_SLUG>`는 Subgraph Studio의 서브그래프 ID이며 서브그래프 세부 정보 페이지에서 찾을 수 있습니다.

## 예제 서브그래프에서

`graph init`가 지원하는 두 번째 모드는 예제 서브그래프에서 새 프로젝트를 만드는 것입니다. 다음 명령은 이 작업을 수행합니다.

```
graph init --studio <SUBGRAPH_SLUG>
```

예제 서브그래프는 사용자 아바타를 관리하고 아바타가 생성되거나 업데이트될 때마다 `NewGravatar` 또는 `UpdateGravatar` 이벤트를 내보내는 Dani Grant의 Gravity 컨트랙트를 기반으로 합니다. 서브그래프는 그래프 노드 저장소에 `Gravatar` 엔터티를 작성하고 이벤트에 따라 업데이트되도록 하여 이러한 이벤트를 처리합니다. 다음 섹션에서는 이 예제의 서브그래프 매니페스트를 구성하는 파일에 대해 설명합니다.

## 서브그래프 매니페스트

서브그래프 매니페스트`subgraph.yaml`은 서브그래프가 인덱스하는 스마트 컨트랙트, 이러한 컨트랙트에서 주의해야 할 이벤트, 그래프 노드가 저장하고 쿼리할 수 있는 엔터티에 이벤트 데이터를 매핑하는 방법을 정의합니다. 서브그래프 매니페스트에 대한 전체 사양은 [여기](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node/blob/master/docs/subgraph-manifest.md).에서 찾을 수 있습니다.

예제 서브그래프에 관한 `subgraph.yaml`는 다음과 같습니다:

```yaml
specVersion: 0.0.4
description: Gravatar for Ethereum
repository: https://github.com/graphprotocol/example-subgraph
schema:
  file: ./schema.graphql
dataSources:
  - kind: ethereum/contract
    name: Gravity
    network: mainnet
    source:
      address: '0x2E645469f354BB4F5c8a05B3b30A929361cf77eC'
      abi: Gravity
      startBlock: 6175244
    mapping:
      kind: ethereum/events
      apiVersion: 0.0.6
      language: wasm/assemblyscript
      entities:
        - Gravatar
      abis:
        - name: Gravity
          file: ./abis/Gravity.json
      eventHandlers:
        - event: NewGravatar(uint256,address,string,string)
          handler: handleNewGravatar
        - event: UpdatedGravatar(uint256,address,string,string)
          handler: handleUpdatedGravatar
      callHandlers:
        - function: createGravatar(string,string)
          handler: handleCreateGravatar
      blockHandlers:
        - function: handleBlock
        - function: handleBlockWithCall
          filter:
            kind: call
      file: ./src/mapping.ts
```

매니페스트에 대해 업데이트해야 할 중요한 항목은 다음과 같습니다.

- `description`: 서브그래프가 무엇인지에 대한 사람이 읽을 수 있는 설명입니다. 이 설명은 서브그래프가 호스팅 서비스에 배포될 때 그래프 탐색기에 의해 표시됩니다.

- `repository`: 서브그래프 매니페스트를 찾을 수 있는 저장소의 URL입니다. 이것은 그래프 탐색기에서도 표시됩니다.

- `features`: 사용된 모든 [feature](#experimental-features) 이름들의 리스트입니다.

- `dataSources.source`: 서브그래프 소스의 스마트 컨트랙트 주소 및 사용할 스마트 컨트랙트의 abi는 선택 사항입니다. 생략하면 모든 컨트랙트에서 일치하는 이벤트를 인덱싱할 수 있습니다.

- `dataSources.source.startBlock`: 데이터 소스가 인덱싱을 시작하는 블록의 선택적 번호입니다. 대부분의 경우 컨트랙트가 생성된 블록을 사용하는 것이 좋습니다.

- `dataSources.mapping.entities`: 데이터 원본이 저장소에 작성하는 엔터티입니다. 각 엔티티의 스키마는 schema.graphql 파일에 정의되어 있습니다.

- `dataSources.mapping.abis`: 소스 컨트랙트에 대한 하나 이상의 명명된 ABI 파일 및 매핑 내에서 상호 작용하는 다른 모든 스마트 컨트랙트.

- `dataSources.mapping.eventHandlers`: 이 서브그래프가 반응하는 스마트 컨트랙트 이벤트와 이러한 이벤트를 저장소의 엔터티로 변환하는 매핑의 핸들러(예제에서는./src/mapping.ts)를 나열합니다.

- `dataSources.mapping.callHandlers`: lists the smart contract functions this subgraph reacts to and handlers in the mapping that transform the inputs and outputs to function calls into entities in the store.

- `dataSources.mapping.blockHandlers`: lists the blocks this subgraph reacts to and handlers in the mapping to run when a block is appended to the chain. Without a filter, the block handler will be run every block. An optional filter can be provided with the following kinds: call`. A`call` filter will run the handler if the block contains at least one call to the data source contract.

A single subgraph can index data from multiple smart contracts. Add an entry for each contract from which data needs to be indexed to the `dataSources` array.

The triggers for a data source within a block are ordered using the following process:

1. Event and call triggers are first ordered by transaction index within the block.
2. Event and call triggers with in the same transaction are ordered using a convention: event triggers first then call triggers, each type respecting the order they are defined in the manifest.
3. Block triggers are run after event and call triggers, in the order they are defined in the manifest.

These ordering rules are subject to change.

### Getting The ABIs

The ABI file(s) must match your contract(s). There are a few ways to obtain ABI files:

- If you are building your own project, you will likely have access to your most current ABIs.
- If you are building a subgraph for a public project, you can download that project to your computer and get the ABI by using [`truffle compile`](https://truffleframework.com/docs/truffle/overview) or using solc to compile.
- You can also find the ABI on [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/), but this isn't always reliable, as the ABI that is uploaded there may be out of date. Make sure you have the right ABI, otherwise running your subgraph will fail.

## The GraphQL Schema

The schema for your subgraph is in the file `schema.graphql`. GraphQL schemas are defined using the GraphQL interface definition language. If you've never written a GraphQL schema, it is recommended that you check out this primer on the GraphQL type system. Reference documentation for GraphQL schemas can be found in the [GraphQL API](/developer/graphql-api) section.

## Defining Entities

Before defining entities, it is important to take a step back and think about how your data is structured and linked. All queries will be made against the data model defined in the subgraph schema and the entities indexed by the subgraph. Because of this, it is good to define the subgraph schema in a way that matches the needs of your dapp. It may be useful to imagine entities as "objects containing data", rather than as events or functions.

With The Graph, you simply define entity types in `schema.graphql`, and Graph Node will generate top level fields for querying single instances and collections of that entity type. Each type that should be an entity is required to be annotated with an `@entity` directive.

### Good Example

The `Gravatar` entity below is structured around a Gravatar object and is a good example of how an entity could be defined.

```graphql
type Gravatar @entity {
  id: ID!
  owner: Bytes
  displayName: String
  imageUrl: String
  accepted: Boolean
}
```

### Bad Example

The example `GravatarAccepted` and `GravatarDeclined` entities below are based around events. It is not recommended to map events or function calls to entities 1:1.

```graphql
type GravatarAccepted @entity {
  id: ID!
  owner: Bytes
  displayName: String
  imageUrl: String
}

type GravatarDeclined @entity {
  id: ID!
  owner: Bytes
  displayName: String
  imageUrl: String
}
```

### Optional and Required Fields

Entity fields can be defined as required or optional. Required fields are indicated by the `!` in the schema. If a required field is not set in the mapping, you will receive this error when querying the field:

```
Null value resolved for non-null field 'name'
```

Each entity must have an `id` field, which is of type `ID!` (string). The `id` field serves as the primary key, and needs to be unique among all entities of the same type.

### Built-In Scalar Types

#### GraphQL Supported Scalars

We support the following scalars in our GraphQL API:

| Type         | Description                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Bytes`      | Byte array, represented as a hexadecimal string. Commonly used for Ethereum hashes and addresses.                                                                                    |
| `ID`         | Stored as a `string`.                                                                                                                                                                |
| `String`     | Scalar for `string` values. Null characters are not supported and are automatically removed.                                                                                         |
| `Boolean`    | Scalar for `boolean` values.                                                                                                                                                         |
| `Int`        | The GraphQL spec defines `Int` to have size of 32 bytes.                                                                                                                             |
| `BigInt`     | Large integers. Used for Ethereum's `uint32`, `int64`, `uint64`, ..., `uint256` types. Note: Everything below `uint32`, such as `int32`, `uint24` or `int8` is represented as `i32`. |
| `BigDecimal` | `BigDecimal` High precision decimals represented as a signficand and an exponent. The exponent range is from −6143 to +6144. Rounded to 34 significant digits.                       |

#### Enums

You can also create enums within a schema. Enums have the following syntax:

```graphql
enum TokenStatus {
  OriginalOwner
  SecondOwner
  ThirdOwner
}
```

Once the enum is defined in the schema, you can use the string representation of the enum value to set an enum field on an entity. For example, you can set the `tokenStatus` to `SecondOwner` by first defining your entity and subsequently setting the field with `entity.tokenStatus = "SecondOwner`. The example below demonstrates what the Token entity would look like with an enum field:

More detail on writing enums can be found in the [GraphQL documentation](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/).

#### Entity Relationships

An entity may have a relationship to one or more other entities in your schema. These relationships may be traversed in your queries. Relationships in The Graph are unidirectional. It is possible to simulate bidirectional relationships by defining a unidirectional relationship on either "end" of the relationship.

Relationships are defined on entities just like any other field except that the type specified is that of another entity.

#### One-To-One Relationships

Define a `Transaction` entity type with an optional one-to-one relationship with a `TransactionReceipt` entity type:

```graphql
type Transaction @entity {
  id: ID!
  transactionReceipt: TransactionReceipt
}

type TransactionReceipt @entity {
  id: ID!
  transaction: Transaction
}
```

#### One-To-Many Relationships

Define a `TokenBalance` entity type with a required one-to-many relationship with a Token entity type:

```graphql
type Token @entity {
  id: ID!
}

type TokenBalance @entity {
  id: ID!
  amount: Int!
  token: Token!
}
```

#### Reverse Lookups

Reverse lookups can be defined on an entity through the `@derivedFrom` field. This creates a virtual field on the entity that may be queried but cannot be set manually through the mappings API. Rather, it is derived from the relationship defined on the other entity. For such relationships, it rarely makes sense to store both sides of the relationship, and both indexing and query performance will be better when only one side is stored and the other is derived.

For one-to-many relationships, the relationship should always be stored on the 'one' side, and the 'many' side should always be derived. Storing the relationship this way, rather than storing an array of entities on the 'many' side, will result in dramatically better performance for both indexing and querying the subgraph. In general, storing arrays of entities should be avoided as much as is practical.

#### Example

We can make the balances for a token accessible from the token by deriving a `tokenBalances` field:

```graphql
type Token @entity {
  id: ID!
  tokenBalances: [TokenBalance!]! @derivedFrom(field: "token")
}

type TokenBalance @entity {
  id: ID!
  amount: Int!
  token: Token!
}
```

#### Many-To-Many Relationships

For many-to-many relationships, such as users that each may belong to any number of organizations, the most straightforward, but generally not the most performant, way to model the relationship is as an array in each of the two entities involved. If the relationship is symmetric, only one side of the relationship needs to be stored and the other side can be derived.

#### Example

Define a reverse lookup from a `User` entity type to an `Organization` entity type. In the example below, this is achieved by looking up the `members` attribute from within the `Organization` entity. In queries, the `organizations` field on `User` will be resolved by finding all `Organization` entities that include the user's ID.

```graphql
type Organization @entity {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  members: [User!]!
}

type User @entity {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  organizations: [Organization!]! @derivedFrom(field: "members")
}
```

A more performant way to store this relationship is through a mapping table that has one entry for each `User` / `Organization` pair with a schema like

```graphql
type Organization @entity {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  members: [UserOrganization]! @derivedFrom(field: "user")
}

type User @entity {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  organizations: [UserOrganization!] @derivedFrom(field: "organization")
}

type UserOrganization @entity {
  id: ID! # Set to `${user.id}-${organization.id}`
  user: User!
  organization: Organization!
}
```

This approach requires that queries descend into one additional level to retrieve, for example, the organizations for users:

```graphql
query usersWithOrganizations {
  users {
    organizations {
      # this is a UserOrganization entity
      organization {
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This more elaborate way of storing many-to-many relationships will result in less data stored for the subgraph, and therefore to a subgraph that is often dramatically faster to index and to query.

#### Adding comments to the schema

As per GraphQL spec, comments can be added above schema entity attributes using double quotations `""`. This is illustrated in the example below:

```graphql
type MyFirstEntity @entity {
  "unique identifier and primary key of the entity"
  id: ID!
  address: Bytes!
}
```

## Defining Fulltext Search Fields

Fulltext search queries filter and rank entities based on a text search input. Fulltext queries are able to return matches for similar words by processing the query text input into stems before comparing to the indexed text data.

A fulltext query definition includes the query name, the language dictionary used to process the text fields, the ranking algorithm used to order the results, and the fields included in the search. Each fulltext query may span multiple fields, but all included fields must be from a single entity type.

To add a fulltext query, include a `_Schema_` type with a fulltext directive in the GraphQL schema.

```graphql
type _Schema_
  @fulltext(
    name: "bandSearch"
    language: en
    algorithm: rank
    include: [{ entity: "Band", fields: [{ name: "name" }, { name: "description" }, { name: "bio" }] }]
  )

type Band @entity {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  description: String!
  bio: String
  wallet: Address
  labels: [Label!]!
  discography: [Album!]!
  members: [Musician!]!
}
```

The example `bandSearch` field can be used in queries to filter `Band` entities based on the text documents in the `name`, `description`, and `bio` fields. Jump to [GraphQL API - Queries](/developer/graphql-api#queries) for a description of the Fulltext search API and for more example usage.

```graphql
query {
  bandSearch(text: "breaks & electro & detroit") {
    id
    name
    description
    wallet
  }
}
```

> **[Feature Management](#experimental-features):** From `specVersion` `0.0.4` and onwards, `fullTextSearch` must be declared under the `features` section in the subgraph manifest.

### Languages supported

Choosing a different language will have a definitive, though sometimes subtle, effect on the fulltext search API. Fields covered by a fulltext query field are examined in the context of the chosen language, so the lexemes produced by analysis and search queries vary language to language. For example: when using the supported Turkish dictionary "token" is stemmed to "toke" while, of course, the English dictionary will stem it to "token".

Supported language dictionaries:

| Code   | Dictionary |
| ------ | ---------- |
| simple | General    |
| da     | Danish     |
| nl     | Dutch      |
| en     | English    |
| fi     | Finnish    |
| fr     | French     |
| de     | German     |
| hu     | Hungarian  |
| it     | Italian    |
| no     | Norwegian  |
| pt     | Portugese  |
| ro     | Romanian   |
| ru     | Russian    |
| es     | Spanish    |
| sv     | Swedish    |
| tr     | Turkish    |

### Ranking Algorithms

Supported algorithms for ordering results:

| Algorithm     | Description                                                             |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| rank          | Use the match quality (0-1) of the fulltext query to order the results. |
| proximityRank | Similar to rank but also includes the proximity of the matches.         |

## Writing Mappings

The mappings transform the Ethereum data your mappings are sourcing into entities defined in your schema. Mappings are written in a subset of [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html) called [AssemblyScript](https://github.com/AssemblyScript/assemblyscript/wiki) which can be compiled to WASM ([WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/)). AssemblyScript is stricter than normal TypeScript, yet provides a familiar syntax.

For each event handler that is defined in `subgraph.yaml` under `mapping.eventHandlers`, create an exported function of the same name. Each handler must accept a single parameter called `event` with a type corresponding to the name of the event which is being handled.

In the example subgraph, `src/mapping.ts` contains handlers for the `NewGravatar` and `UpdatedGravatar` events:

```javascript
import { NewGravatar, UpdatedGravatar } from '../generated/Gravity/Gravity'
import { Gravatar } from '../generated/schema'

export function handleNewGravatar(event: NewGravatar): void {
  let gravatar = new Gravatar(event.params.id.toHex())
  gravatar.owner = event.params.owner
  gravatar.displayName = event.params.displayName
  gravatar.imageUrl = event.params.imageUrl
  gravatar.save()
}

export function handleUpdatedGravatar(event: UpdatedGravatar): void {
  let id = event.params.id.toHex()
  let gravatar = Gravatar.load(id)
  if (gravatar == null) {
    gravatar = new Gravatar(id)
  }
  gravatar.owner = event.params.owner
  gravatar.displayName = event.params.displayName
  gravatar.imageUrl = event.params.imageUrl
  gravatar.save()
}
```

The first handler takes a `NewGravatar` event and creates a new `Gravatar` entity with `new Gravatar(event.params.id.toHex())`, populating the entity fields using the corresponding event parameters. This entity instance is represented by the variable `gravatar`, with an id value of `event.params.id.toHex()`.

The second handler tries to load the existing `Gravatar` from the Graph Node store. If it does not exist yet, it is created on demand. The entity is then updated to match the new event parameters, before it is saved back to the store using `gravatar.save()`.

### Recommended IDs for Creating New Entities

Every entity has to have an `id` that is unique among all entities of the same type. An entity's `id` value is set when the entity is created. Below are some recommended `id` values to consider when creating new entities. NOTE: The value of `id` must be a `string`.

- `event.params.id.toHex()`
- `event.transaction.from.toHex()`
- `event.transaction.hash.toHex() + "-" + event.logIndex.toString()`

We provide the [Graph Typescript Library](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-ts) which contains utilies for interacting with the Graph Node store and conveniences for handling smart contract data and entities. You can use this library in your mappings by importing `@graphprotocol/graph-ts` in `mapping.ts`.

## Code Generation

In order to make working smart contracts, events and entities easy and type-safe, the Graph CLI can generate AssemblyScript types from the subgraph's GraphQL schema and the contract ABIs included in the data sources.

This is done with

```sh
graph codegen [--output-dir <OUTPUT_DIR>] [<MANIFEST>]
```

but in most cases, subgraphs are already preconfigured via `package.json` to allow you to simply run one of the following to achieve the same:

```sh
# Yarn
yarn codegen

# NPM
npm run codegen
```

This will generate an AssemblyScript class for every smart contract in the ABI files mentioned in `subgraph.yaml`, allowing you to bind these contracts to specific addresses in the mappings and call read-only contract methods against the block being processed. It will also generate a class for every contract event to provide easy access to event parameters as well as the block and transaction the event originated from. All of these types are written to `<OUTPUT_DIR>/<DATA_SOURCE_NAME>/<ABI_NAME>.ts`. In the example subgraph, this would be `generated/Gravity/Gravity.ts`, allowing mappings to import these types with

```javascript
import {
  // The contract class:
  Gravity,
  // The events classes:
  NewGravatar,
  UpdatedGravatar,
} from '../generated/Gravity/Gravity'
```

In addition to this, one class is generated for each entity type in the subgraph's GraphQL schema. These classes provide type-safe entity loading, read and write access to entity fields as well as a `save()` method to write entities to store. All entity classes are written to `<OUTPUT_DIR>/schema.ts`, allowing mappings to import them with

```javascript
import { Gravatar } from '../generated/schema'
```

> **Note:** The code generation must be performed again after every change to the GraphQL schema or the ABIs included in the manifest. It must also be performed at least once before building or deploying the subgraph.

Code generation does not check your mapping code in `src/mapping.ts`. If you want to check that before trying to deploy your subgraph to the Graph Explorer, you can run `yarn build` and fix any syntax errors that the TypeScript compiler might find.

## Data Source Templates

A common pattern in Ethereum smart contracts is the use of registry or factory contracts, where one contract creates, manages or references an arbitrary number of other contracts that each have their own state and events. The addresses of these sub-contracts may or may not be known upfront and many of these contracts may be created and/or added over time. This is why, in such cases, defining a single data source or a fixed number of data sources is impossible and a more dynamic approach is needed: _data source templates_.

### Data Source for the Main Contract

First, you define a regular data source for the main contract. The snippet below shows a simplified example data source for the [Uniswap](https://uniswap.io) exchange factory contract. Note the `NewExchange(address,address)` event handler. This is emitted when a new exchange contract is created on chain by the factory contract.

```yaml
dataSources:
  - kind: ethereum/contract
    name: Factory
    network: mainnet
    source:
      address: '0xc0a47dFe034B400B47bDaD5FecDa2621de6c4d95'
      abi: Factory
    mapping:
      kind: ethereum/events
      apiVersion: 0.0.6
      language: wasm/assemblyscript
      file: ./src/mappings/factory.ts
      entities:
        - Directory
      abis:
        - name: Factory
          file: ./abis/factory.json
      eventHandlers:
        - event: NewExchange(address,address)
          handler: handleNewExchange
```

### Data Source Templates for Dynamically Created Contracts

Then, you add _data source templates_ to the manifest. These are identical to regular data sources, except that they lack a predefined contract address under `source`. Typically, you would define one template for each type of sub-contract managed or referenced by the parent contract.

```yaml
dataSources:
  - kind: ethereum/contract
    name: Factory
    # ... other source fields for the main contract ...
templates:
  - name: Exchange
    kind: ethereum/contract
    network: mainnet
    source:
      abi: Exchange
    mapping:
      kind: ethereum/events
      apiVersion: 0.0.6
      language: wasm/assemblyscript
      file: ./src/mappings/exchange.ts
      entities:
        - Exchange
      abis:
        - name: Exchange
          file: ./abis/exchange.json
      eventHandlers:
        - event: TokenPurchase(address,uint256,uint256)
          handler: handleTokenPurchase
        - event: EthPurchase(address,uint256,uint256)
          handler: handleEthPurchase
        - event: AddLiquidity(address,uint256,uint256)
          handler: handleAddLiquidity
        - event: RemoveLiquidity(address,uint256,uint256)
          handler: handleRemoveLiquidity
```

### Instantiating a Data Source Template

In the final step, you update your main contract mapping to create a dynamic data source instance from one of the templates. In this example, you would change the main contract mapping to import the `Exchange` template and call the `Exchange.create(address)` method on it to start indexing the new exchange contract.

```typescript
import { Exchange } from '../generated/templates'

export function handleNewExchange(event: NewExchange): void {
  // Start indexing the exchange; `event.params.exchange` is the
  // address of the new exchange contract
  Exchange.create(event.params.exchange)
}
```

> **Note:** A new data source will only process the calls and events for the block in which it was created and all following blocks, but will not process historical data, i.e., data that is contained in prior blocks.
> 
> If prior blocks contain data relevant to the new data source, it is best to index that data by reading the current state of the contract and creating entities representing that state at the time the new data source is created.

### Data Source Context

Data source contexts allow passing extra configuration when instantiating a template. In our example, let's say exchanges are associated with a particular trading pair, which is included in the `NewExchange` event. That information can be passed into the instantiated data source, like so:

```typescript
import { Exchange } from '../generated/templates'

export function handleNewExchange(event: NewExchange): void {
  let context = new DataSourceContext()
  context.setString('tradingPair', event.params.tradingPair)
  Exchange.createWithContext(event.params.exchange, context)
}
```

Inside a mapping of the `Exchange` template, the context can then be accessed:

```typescript
import { dataSource } from '@graphprotocol/graph-ts'

let context = dataSource.context()
let tradingPair = context.getString('tradingPair')
```

There are setters and getters like `setString` and `getString` for all value types.

## Start Blocks

The `startBlock` is an optional setting that allows you to define from which block in the chain the data source will start indexing. Setting the start block allows the data source to skip potentially millions of blocks that are irrelevant. Typically, a subgraph developer will set `startBlock` to the block in which the smart contract of the data source was created.

```yaml
dataSources:
  - kind: ethereum/contract
    name: ExampleSource
    network: mainnet
    source:
      address: '0xc0a47dFe034B400B47bDaD5FecDa2621de6c4d95'
      abi: ExampleContract
      startBlock: 6627917
    mapping:
      kind: ethereum/events
      apiVersion: 0.0.6
      language: wasm/assemblyscript
      file: ./src/mappings/factory.ts
      entities:
        - User
      abis:
        - name: ExampleContract
          file: ./abis/ExampleContract.json
      eventHandlers:
        - event: NewEvent(address,address)
          handler: handleNewEvent
```

> **Note:** The contract creation block can be quickly looked up on Etherscan:
> 
> 1. Search for the contract by entering its address in the search bar.
> 2. Click on the creation transaction hash in the `Contract Creator` section.
> 3. Load the transaction details page where you'll find the start block for that contract.

## Call Handlers

While events provide an effective way to collect relevant changes to the state of a contract, many contracts avoid generating logs to optimize gas costs. In these cases, a subgraph can subscribe to calls made to the data source contract. This is achieved by defining call handlers referencing the function signature and the mapping handler that will process calls to this function. To process these calls, the mapping handler will receive an `ethereum.Call` as an argument with the typed inputs to and outputs from the call. Calls made at any depth in a transaction's call chain will trigger the mapping, allowing activity with the data source contract through proxy contracts to be captured.

Call handlers will only trigger in one of two cases: when the function specified is called by an account other than the contract itself or when it is marked as external in Solidity and called as part of another function in the same contract.

> **Note:** Call handlers are not supported on Rinkeby, Goerli or Ganache. Call handlers currently depend on the Parity tracing API and these networks do not support it.

### Defining a Call Handler

To define a call handler in your manifest simply add a `callHandlers` array under the data source you would like to subscribe to.

```yaml
dataSources:
  - kind: ethereum/contract
    name: Gravity
    network: mainnet
    source:
      address: '0x731a10897d267e19b34503ad902d0a29173ba4b1'
      abi: Gravity
    mapping:
      kind: ethereum/events
      apiVersion: 0.0.6
      language: wasm/assemblyscript
      entities:
        - Gravatar
        - Transaction
      abis:
        - name: Gravity
          file: ./abis/Gravity.json
      callHandlers:
        - function: createGravatar(string,string)
          handler: handleCreateGravatar
```

The `function` is the normalized function signature to filter calls by. The `handler` property is the name of the function in your mapping you would like to execute when the target function is called in the data source contract.

### Mapping Function

Each call handler takes a single parameter that has a type corresponding to the name of the called function. In the example subgraph above, the mapping contains a handler for when the `createGravatar` function is called and receives a `CreateGravatarCall` parameter as an argument:

```typescript
import { CreateGravatarCall } from '../generated/Gravity/Gravity'
import { Transaction } from '../generated/schema'

export function handleCreateGravatar(call: CreateGravatarCall): void {
  let id = call.transaction.hash.toHex()
  let transaction = new Transaction(id)
  transaction.displayName = call.inputs._displayName
  transaction.imageUrl = call.inputs._imageUrl
  transaction.save()
}
```

The `handleCreateGravatar` function takes a new `CreateGravatarCall` which is a subclass of `ethereum.Call`, provided by `@graphprotocol/graph-ts`, that includes the typed inputs and outputs of the call. The `CreateGravatarCall` type is generated for you when you run `graph codegen`.

## Block Handlers

In addition to subscribing to contract events or function calls, a subgraph may want to update its data as new blocks are appended to the chain. To achieve this a subgraph can run a function after every block or after blocks that match a predefined filter.

### Supported Filters

```yaml
filter:
  kind: call
```

_The defined handler will be called once for every block which contains a call to the contract (data source) the handler is defined under._

The absense of a filter for a block handler will ensure that the handler is called every block. A data source can only contain one block handler for each filter type.

```yaml
dataSources:
  - kind: ethereum/contract
    name: Gravity
    network: dev
    source:
      address: '0x731a10897d267e19b34503ad902d0a29173ba4b1'
      abi: Gravity
    mapping:
      kind: ethereum/events
      apiVersion: 0.0.6
      language: wasm/assemblyscript
      entities:
        - Gravatar
        - Transaction
      abis:
        - name: Gravity
          file: ./abis/Gravity.json
      blockHandlers:
        - handler: handleBlock
        - handler: handleBlockWithCallToContract
          filter:
            kind: call
```

### Mapping Function

The mapping function will receive an `ethereum.Block` as its only argument. Like mapping functions for events, this function can access existing subgraph entities in the store, call smart contracts and create or update entities.

```typescript
import { ethereum } from '@graphprotocol/graph-ts'

export function handleBlock(block: ethereum.Block): void {
  let id = block.hash.toHex()
  let entity = new Block(id)
  entity.save()
}
```

## Anonymous Events

If you need to process anonymous events in Solidity, that can be achieved by providing the topic 0 of the event, as in the example:

```yaml
eventHandlers:
  - event: LogNote(bytes4,address,bytes32,bytes32,uint256,bytes)
    topic0: '0xbaa8529c00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000'
    handler: handleGive
```

An event will only be triggered when both the signature and topic 0 match. By default, `topic0` is equal to the hash of the event signature.

## Experimental features

Starting from `specVersion` `0.0.4`, subgraph features must be explicitly declared in the `features` section at the top level of the manifest file, using their `camelCase` name, as listed in the table below:

| Feature                                                   | Name                      |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| [Non-fatal errors](#non-fatal-errors)                     | `nonFatalErrors`          |
| [Full-text Search](#defining-fulltext-search-fields)      | `fullTextSearch`          |
| [Grafting](#grafting-onto-existing-subgraphs)             | `grafting`                |
| [IPFS on Ethereum Contracts](#ipfs-on-ethereum-contracts) | `ipfsOnEthereumContracts` |

For instance, if a subgraph uses the **Full-Text Search** and the **Non-fatal Errors** features, the `features` field in the manifest should be:

```yaml
specVersion: 0.0.4
description: Gravatar for Ethereum
features:
  - fullTextSearch
  - nonFatalErrors
dataSources: ...
```

Note that using a feature without declaring it will incur in a **validation error** during subgraph deployment, but no errors will occur if a feature is declared but not used.

### IPFS on Ethereum Contracts

A common use case for combining IPFS with Ethereum is to store data on IPFS that would be too expensive to maintain on chain, and reference the IPFS hash in Ethereum contracts.

Given such IPFS hashes, subgraphs can read the corresponding files from IPFS using `ipfs.cat` and `ipfs.map`. To do this reliably, however, it is required that these files are pinned on the IPFS node that the Graph Node indexing the subgraph connects to. In the case of the [hosted service](https://thegraph.com/hosted-service), this is [https://api.thegraph.com/ipfs/](https://api.thegraph.com/ipfs/).

> **Note:** The Graph Network does not yet support `ipfs.cat` and `ipfs.map`, and developers should not deploy subgraphs using that functionality to the network via the Studio.

In order to make this easy for subgraph developers, The Graph team wrote a tool for transfering files from one IPFS node to another, called [ipfs-sync](https://github.com/graphprotocol/ipfs-sync).

> **[Feature Management](#experimental-features):** `ipfsOnEthereumContracts` must be declared under `features` in the subgraph manifest.

### Non-fatal errors

Indexing errors on already synced subgraphs will, by default, cause the subgraph to fail and stop syncing. Subgraphs can alternatively be configured to continue syncing in the presence of errors, by ignoring the changes made by the handler which provoked the error. This gives subgraph authors time to correct their subgraphs while queries continue to be served against the latest block, though the results will possibly be inconsistent due to the bug that caused the error. Note that some errors are still always fatal, to be non-fatal the error must be known to be deterministic.

> **Note:** The Graph Network does not yet support non-fatal errors, and developers should not deploy subgraphs using that functionality to the network via the Studio.

Enabling non-fatal errors requires setting the following feature flag on the subgraph manifest:

```yaml
specVersion: 0.0.4
description: Gravatar for Ethereum
features:
    - fullTextSearch
    ...
```

The query must also opt-in to querying data with potential inconsistencies through the `subgraphError` argument. It is also recommended to query `_meta` to check if the subgraph has skipped over errors, as in the example:

```graphql
foos(first: 100, subgraphError: allow) {
  id
}

_meta {
  hasIndexingErrors
}
```

If the subgraph encounters an error that query will return both the data and a graphql error with the message `"indexing_error"`, as in this example response:

```graphql
"data": {
    "foos": [
        {
          "id": "fooId"
        }
    ],
    "_meta": {
        "hasIndexingErrors": true
    }
},
"errors": [
    {
        "message": "indexing_error"
    }
]
```

### Grafting onto Existing Subgraphs

When a subgraph is first deployed, it starts indexing events at the genesis block of the corresponding chain (or at the `startBlock` defined with each data source) In some circumstances, it is beneficial to reuse the data from an existing subgraph and start indexing at a much later block. This mode of indexing is called _Grafting_. Grafting is, for example, useful during development to get past simple errors in the mappings quickly, or to temporarily get an existing subgraph working again after it has failed.

> **Note:** Grafting requires that the Indexer has indexed the base subgraph. It is not recommended on The Graph Network at this time, and developers should not deploy subgraphs using that functionality to the network via the Studio.

A subgraph is grafted onto a base subgraph when the subgraph manifest in `subgraph.yaml` contains a `graft` block at the toplevel:

```yaml
description: ...
graft:
  base: Qm... # Subgraph ID of base subgraph
  block: 7345624 # Block number
```

When a subgraph whose manifest contains a `graft` block is deployed, Graph Node will copy the data of the `base` subgraph up to and including the given `block` and then continue indexing the new subgraph from that block on. The base subgraph must exist on the target Graph Node instance and must have indexed up to at least the given block. Because of this restriction, grafting should only be used during development or during an emergency to speed up producing an equivalent non-grafted subgraph.

Because grafting copies rather than indexes base data it is much quicker in getting the subgraph to the desired block than indexing from scratch, though the initial data copy can still take several hours for very large subgraphs. While the grafted subgraph is being initialized, the Graph Node will log information about the entity types that have already been copied.

The grafted subgraph can use a GraphQL schema that is not identical to the one of the base subgraph, but merely compatible with it. It has to be a valid subgraph schema in its own right but may deviate from the base subgraph's schema in the following ways:

- It adds or removes entity types
- It removes attributes from entity types
- It adds nullable attributes to entity types
- It turns non-nullable attributes into nullable attributes
- It adds values to enums
- It adds or removes interfaces
- It changes for which entity types an interface is implemented

> **[Feature Management](#experimental-features):** `grafting` must be declared under `features` in the subgraph manifest.
